## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

### What I learned

As a beginner this project helped me to:
a) Understand and implement the nested layouts using CSS flexbox.
b) Understand and implement responsive design using media queries.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my understanding of CSS layout and responsive design will look to improve these 2 areas in future projects
